<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Angular project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn-ng@latest init
```

<Callout class="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag for defaults i.e `new-york`, `zinc` and `yes` for the css variables.

```bash
npx shadcn-ng@latest init -d
```

</Callout>

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```
### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ng@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```angular-ts {2,6,7} showLineNumbers
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { UbButtonDirective } from "~/components/ui/button";

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    imports: [UbButtonDirective],
    template: `<button ubButton>Button</button>`,
})
export class ButtonDemoComponent {}
```

</Steps>
