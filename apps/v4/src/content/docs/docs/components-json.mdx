title: components.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

<Callout class="mt-6" title="Note: The `components.json` file is optional">
  It is **only required if you're using the CLI** to add components to your
  project. If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this file.
</Callout>

You can create a `components.json` file in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ng@latest init
```

See the <a href="/docs/cli">CLI section</a> for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for `components.json` [here](https://ui.adrianub.dev/schema.json).

```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.adrianub.dev/schema.json"
}
```

## style

The style for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "style": "new-york"
}
```

The `default` style has been deprecated. Use the `new-york` style instead.

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the <a href="/docs/installation">installation section</a> for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your `tailwind.config.js` file is located. **For Tailwind CSS v4, leave this blank.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "src/styles.css"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.baseColor

This is used to generate the default color palette for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "baseColor": "gray" | "neutral" | "slate" | "stone" | "zinc"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.cssVariables

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false`. For CSS variables, set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": `true` | `false`
  }
}
```

For more information, see the <a href="/docs/theming">theming docs</a>.

**This cannot be changed after initialization.** To switch between CSS variables and utility classes, you'll have to delete and re-install your components.

### tailwind.prefix

The prefix to use for your Tailwind CSS utility classes. Components will be added with this prefix.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "prefix": "tw-"
  }
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` file.

### aliases.utils

Import alias for your utility functions.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### aliases.components

Import alias for your components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### aliases.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "ui": "@/app/ui"
  }
}
```

### aliases.lib

Import alias for `lib` functions such as `format-date` or `generate-id`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "lib": "@/lib"
  }
}
```

## registries

Configure multiple resource registries for your project. This allows you to install components, libraries, utilities, and other resources from various sources including private registries.

See the <a href="/docs/registry/namespace">Namespaced Registries</a> documentation for detailed information.

### Basic Configuration

Configure registries with URL templates:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@acme": "https://registry.acme.com/{name}.json",
    "@internal": "https://internal.company.com/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

The `{name}` placeholder is replaced with the resource name when installing.

### Advanced Configuration with Authentication

For private registries that require authentication:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@private": {
      "url": "https://api.company.com/registry/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${REGISTRY_TOKEN}",
        "X-API-Key": "${API_KEY}"
      },
      "params": {
        "version": "latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables in the format `${VAR_NAME}` are automatically expanded from your environment.

### Using Namespaced Registries

nce configured, install resources using the namespace syntax:

```bash
# Install from private registry
npx shadcn-ng@latest add @private/button

# Install multiple resources
npx shadcn-ng@latest add @acme/header @internal/auth-utils
```

### Example: Multiple Registry Setup

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@shadcn": "https://ui.shadcn.dev/r/{name}.json",
    "@company-ui": {
      "url": "https://registry.company.com/ui/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${COMPANY_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "@team": {
      "url": "https://team.company.com/{name}.json",
      "params": {
        "team": "frontend",
        "version": "${REGISTRY_VERSION}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration allows you to:

- Install public components from shadcn-ng
- Access private company UI components with authentication
- Use team-specific resources with versioning

For more information about authentication, see the <a href="/docs/registry/authentication">Authentication</a> documentation.
